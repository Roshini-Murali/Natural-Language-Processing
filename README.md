These are the experiments that I have done during the NLP course

List of experiments:

1. Stemming, Lemmatization and Parse trees
2. Collocation ( t-test & chi-square test )
3. Naive Bayes disambiguation algorithm
4. Hindle & Rooth algorithm
5. Hidden Markov Model ( Forward & Backward procedures )
6. Viterbi algorithm
7. Implementation of the Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) with the CYK algorithm
8. Viterbi PCFG algorithm
9. Multi-Layer Perceptron
10. Text generator using LSTM
11. Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Smoothing techniques
